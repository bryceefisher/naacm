                    This market is a gathering of Native American and Indigenous artists and crafters from a diverse<br>
                    representation of Tribal Nations. The first Sunday Native American arts & crafts market is,<br>
                    derived from the annual Eugene Winter arts & crafts market which first began in 2013. Held<br>
                    annually at the Amazon community center, this market began as a thought to bring local Native<br>
                    American community artists and crafters together to sell their creations to our local Eugene and<br>
                    Springfield communities during the winter holiday season. That first market was comprised of a<br>
                    group of Native community friends and family who lived in Eugene and Springfield.

                    a safe and supportive venue for the creativity of Native artisans who create authentic Native<br>
